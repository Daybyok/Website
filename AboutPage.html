            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>During the event, I had the opportunity to participate 3 games as I wanted to play and practice with. It was a memorable experience because of the practice we had in my own team, despite all the failures and pressure we face everyday, we still able to continue our own way to the show. This event taught me how to collaborate, helping others, and most important thing is how to help yourself without needing the help of others.</p>
